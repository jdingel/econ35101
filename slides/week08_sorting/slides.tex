\begin{frame}{Today: Spatial Sorting of Skills and Sectors}
My goal is to tackle three questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why should we care about spatial sorting?
	\item How should we characterize skills and sectors?
	\item What tools are relevant for building and estimating models?
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
We'll discuss three papers in some detail:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Davis \& Dingel - A Spatial Knowledge Economy
	\item Davis \& Dingel - The Comparative Advantage of Cities
	\item Diamond - The Determinants and Welfare Implications of US Workers' Diverging Location Choices by Skill: 1980-2000

Why should we care about the spatial distributions of skills and sectors?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item They vary a lot
	\item They covary with city characteristics
	\item They're often the basis for identification 
	\item They should help us understand how cities work

Skills and sectors are strongly linked to cities' sizes

\begin{frame}{They're often the basis for identification}
JMPs by Notowidigdo, Diamond, and Yagan
\begin{itemize}
	\item Theory: all locations produce a homogeneous good
	\item Empirics: exploit variation in industrial composition to estimate model parameters via shifts in local labor demand
	\item Shift-share instrument: local composition $\times$ national changes
\end{itemize}
What variation does the instrument exploit?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skill mix vs industrial mix (e.g. endogenous local SBTC - \href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/658371}{Beaudry, Doms, Lewis 2010})
	\item City characteristics covarying with skills and sectors highlight exclusion-restriction assumptions

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{They should help us understand how cities work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why do different people and different businesses locate in different places?
	\item The answers should be crucial to understanding how cities work
	\item Which elements of the Marshallian trinity imply we'll find finance and dot-coms in big cities?
	\item Coagglomeration (\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.100.3.1195}{Ellison Glaeser Kerr 2010}) and heterogeneous agglomeration (\href{https://ideas.repec.org/p/ehl/lserod/58426.html}{Faggio, Silva, Strange 2015}) can provide clues
	\item \href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3736487}{Eckert, Ganapati, Walsh (2020)}: Growth since 1980 has been faster in larger cities and it's all about ``skilled scalable services''
	\item Theory is laggard: Most models of sectoral composition are polarized, with \emph{specialized} cities that have only one tradable sector and \emph{perfectly diversified} cities that have all the tradable sectors (\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/676557}{Helsley and Strange 2014})
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Spatial distributions of skills and sectors}
How should we characterize skills and sectors?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Important question for both theory and empirics
\end{itemize}
A richer depiction of firms and workers improves realism, but\dots
\begin{itemize}
	\item more types threaten to make theoretical models intractable
	\item more types increase the burden of finding instruments
\end{itemize}
While the trade-offs are specific to the research question under investigation, we can start by asking: Are two skill groups enough?
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Spatial equilibrium with two skill groups}
A simple starting point
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Two skill groups, $s \in \{L,H\}$
	\item Spatial equilibrium: $U_s(A_c,w_{s,c},p_{c}) = U_s(A_{c'},w_{s,c'},p_{c'}) \ \forall c,c' \ \forall s$
	\item Homotheticity: $U_s(A_{c},w_{s,c},p_{c}) = \frac{w_{s,c}}{A_{c} p_{c}}$
\end{enumerate}
\pause These jointly imply that relative wages are spatially invariant
\begin{align*}
\frac{w_{H,c}}{A_{c} p_{c}} = \frac{w_{H,c'}}{A_{c'} p_{c'}} \quad&\textnormal{ and }\quad \frac{w_{L,c}}{A_{c} p_{c}} = \frac{w_{L,c'}}{A_{c'} p_{c'}} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{w_{H,c}}{w_{L,c}} &= \frac{w_{H,c'}}{w_{L,c'}} \ \forall c,c'

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{How to proceed?}
The data reject our simple model; skill premia are higher in larger cities
\begin{align*}
\frac{w_{H,c}}{w_{L,c}} &\neq \frac{w_{H,c'}}{w_{L,c'}}
\end{align*}
Three possible routes to take
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Non-homothetic preferences \only<2->{(\href{https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jlabec/v27y2009i1p21-47.html}{Black, Kolesnikova, Taylor 2009})}

\end{enumerate}
\only<5->{Both 2 and 3 push us towards thinking about the complementarity between agglomeration and skills}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{A continuum of skills}
Recent research works with a continuum of skills
\begin{itemize}
	\item High-dimensional: Infinite types of individuals
	\item One-dimensional: Skills are ordered
\end{itemize}
A few reasons to take this route
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Dichotomous results depend on dichotomous definitions
	\item Broad categories miss important variation
	\item Continuum case can be quite tractable
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Two types in theory and practice}
Two-type models can be simple -- but what about two-type empirics?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Omit types: Our plot of college wage premia was bachelor's degrees vs HS diplomas -- use only 45\% of population to test price prediction
	\item Convert quantities to ``equivalents'': ``one person with some college is equivalent to a total of 0.69 of a high school graduate and 0.29 of a college graduate'' (\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/2118323}{Katz \& Murphy 1992}, p.68)
\end{itemize}
\pause Results may be sensitive to dichotomous definitions
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Berry \& Glaeser (2005): ``US metropolitan areas with more college graduates in 1990 became increasingly skilled over the 1990s''
	\item \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131706}{Diamond (2016)}: ``A MSA's share of college graduates in 1980 is positively associated with larger growth in its share of college workers from 1980 to 2000''
	\item \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160510}{Baum-Snow, Freedman, Pavan (2015)}: ``Diamond's result does not hold for CBSAs if those with some college education are included in the skilled group.''
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Dichotomous approach misses relevant variation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In labor economics, the canonical two-skill model ``is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades'', such as wage polarization and job polarization (\href{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169721811024105}{Acemoglu and Autor 2011})
	\item There is systematic variation across cities in terms of finer observable categories: population elasticities for high school graduates (.925), associate's degree (0.997), bachelor's degree (1.087), and professional degree (1.113) (Davis and Dingel 2020)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Do broad categories miss important variation?}
Contrasting views
\begin{itemize}
	\item  ``Workers in cities with a well-educated labor force are likely to have unobserved characteristics that make them more productive than workers with the same level of schooling in cities with a less-educated labor force. For example, a lawyer in New York is likely to be different from a lawyer in El Paso, TX.'' (\href{https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/regchp/4-51.html}{Moretti 2004, p.2246})
	\item[] {\small Similar jobs require different tasks and technologies in larger cities (\href{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ssotelo/research/AST_geography.pdf}{Atalay, Sotelo, Tannenbaum 2021})}
	\item ``Within broad occupation or education groups, there appears to be little sorting on ability'' (\href{http://diegopuga.org/research/dreams.pdf}{de la Roca, Ottaviano, Puga 2014})
\end{itemize}
Data sources for ``no sorting'' evidence
\begin{itemize}
	\item NLSY79: Longitudinal study of about 11,000 US individuals
	\item Spanish tax data 2004-2009: 150,375 workers (\href{https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/84/1/106/2669971}{de la Roca and Puga 2017})

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{The continuum case}
Why work with a continuum?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evidence for sorting on characteristics that are typically not observed
	\item Need at least five types to capture sorting on observables in the sense of de la Roca and Puga (2017)
	\item Modeling a finite, particular number of types is potentially painful
\end{itemize}
Continuum case can be quite tractable

\begin{frame}{ Davis \& Dingel - A Spatial Knowledge Economy}
We have models of: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Knowledge spillovers as a pure externality (one interpretation of Henderson 1974, Black 1999, Lucas 2001)
	\item Endogenous exchange of ideas in a single (or symmetric) location(s) (Helsley and Strange 2004, Berliant, Reed III, and Wang 2006, Berliant and Fujita 2008, Lucas and Moll 2011)
\end{itemize}
Our contribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce a model of a system of cities in which costly idea exchange is the agglomeration force 
	\item Our model replicates a broad set of established facts about the cross section of cities
	\item We provide a spatial-equilibrium explanation of why skill premia are higher in larger cities and how this emerges from symmetric fundamentals
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Model summary}
Our model's core components: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Spatial equilibrium -- zero mobility costs 
\item Heterogeneous workers -- continuum of abilities 
\item Two sectors: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tradables: Labor heterogeneity matters for productivity
	\item Non-tradables: Homogeneous productivity
\end{itemize}
\item Skilled tradables sector has local learning opportunities 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Workers choose to spend time exchanging ideas 
	\item Gains from interactions increasing in own ability and peers' ability
\end{itemize}
\item Congestion costs make housing more expensive in larger cities 
\item Workers choose locations, occupations, and time spent exchanging ideas 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Preferences and congestion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Preferences: Unit demand for housing and $\bar{n}$-unit demand for non-tradable:
	\begin{equation*}
	V(p_{n,c},p_{h,c},y)= y-p_{n,c}\bar{n}-p_{h,c}. \label{indirect_utility}
	\end{equation*}
	\item Each individual in a city of population $L_c$ pays a net urban cost (in units of the numeraire) of 
	\begin{equation*}
	p_{h,c} = \theta L_c^\gamma
	\end{equation*}
	\item Individuals are perfectly mobile across cities and jobs, so their locational and occupational choices maximize $V(p_{n,c},p_{h,c},y)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Production}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An individual can produce tradables ($t$) or non-tradables ($n$)
	\item An individual working in sector $\sigma$ earns income equal to the value of her output, which is
		\begin{equation*}
		y =  \Bigg\{\begin{array}{cc}
		p_{n,c} & \textnormal{ if } \sigma = n \\
		\tilde{z}(z,{Z}_{c})  & \textnormal{ if } \sigma = t \end{array}
		\end{equation*}
	\item Tradables production depends on own ability $(z)$, time spent producing ($\beta$), time spent exchanging ideas ($1-\beta$), and local learning opportunities $(Z_{c})$:
		\begin{equation*}
		\tilde{z}(z,Z_c) = \max_{\beta\in[0,1]} B(1-\beta,z,Z_c)
		\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Idea exchange}
Tradables production:
		\begin{equation*}
		\tilde{z}(z,Z_c) = \max_{\beta\in[0,1]} B(1-\beta,z,Z_c)
		\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar $Z_c$ depends on time-allocation decisions of all agents in $c$. 
\item Denote idea-exchange time of ability $z$ in city $c$ by $1-\beta_{z,c}$ 
\item Denote local ability distribution $\mu(z,c)$, where $\frac{\mu(z,c)}{\mu(z)}$ is the share of $z$ in $c$.
		\begin{equation*}
		Z_c = Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c}\},\{\mu(z,c)\}). \label{eqn:bigZfunction}
		\end{equation*}
\item Denote total time devoted to learning by tradables producers in city $c$ by $M_c$
\begin{equation*}
M_{c} = L \int_{z: \sigma(z)=t}(1-\beta_{z,c})\mu(z,c) dz.
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Idea exchange: General assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
{\small
\item \textbf{Assumption 1}. 
The production function for tradables
$B(1-\beta,z,Z_c)$ is continuous,
strictly concave in $1-\beta$,
strictly increasing in $z$, and increasing in $Z_c$.
$B(1-\beta,z,0)=\beta z$ and $B(0,z,Z_c)=z$ $\forall z$.
\item \textbf{Assumption 2}. 
Tradables output $\tilde{z}(z,Z_c)$ is supermodular and
is strictly supermodular on $\otimes \equiv \{(z,Z): \tilde{z}(z,Z)>z\}$.
\item \textbf{Assumption 3}. 
The idea-exchange functional
$Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c}\},\{L\cdot\mu(z,c)\})$
is continuous, equal to zero if $M_c=0$, and bounded above by $\sup \{z:1-\beta_{z,c}>0,\mu(z,c)>0\}$.
If  $M_{c} > M_{c'}$ and $\{(1-\beta_{z,c})\mu(z,c)\}$ stochastically dominates $\{(1-\beta_{z,c'})\mu(z,c')\}$,
then $Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c}\},\{L\cdot\mu(z,c)\})>Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c'}\},\{L\cdot\mu(z,c')\})$.
}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Idea exchange: Special case}
For some of our analysis, we focus on particular functional forms for $B(\cdot)$ and $Z(\cdot)$:
\begin{align*}
&B(1-\beta,z,Z_c) = {\beta}z(1+(1-\beta)A{Z}_{c}z) \\
&Z(\{(1-\beta_{z,c}),\mu(z,c)\})  = \left(1-\exp(-\nu M_c) \right) \bar{z}_{c} \\
\bar{z}_{c} & =\Bigg\{\begin{array}{cc}
\int_{z: \sigma(z)=t}\frac{(1-\beta_{z,c})z}{\int_{z: \sigma(z)=t}(1-\beta_{z,c})\mu(z,c) dz}\mu(z,c) dz & \textnormal{ if }M_{c}>0\\
0 & \textnormal{ otherwise } \nonumber
\end{array} 
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random matching: Probability of encounter during each moment of time spent seeking idea exchanges is $\left(1-\exp(-\nu M_c) \right)$
	\item $M_{c}$ is the total time devoted to idea exchange
	\item $\bar{z}_{c}$ is the average ability of the individuals encountered
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Two lemmas}
\begin{lemma}[Comparative advantage]
\label{lemma:ComparativeAdvantage}
Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. There is an ability level $z_m$ such that individuals of greater ability produce tradables and individuals of lesser ability produce non-tradables. 
\begin{align*}
\sigma(z) =  \Bigg\{\begin{array}{cc}
t & \textnormal{ if } z > z_m \\

Since 1980, college graduates have been concentrating in US cities with faster wage and housing-price growth. Questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why are they doing so?
	\item Is this spatial divergence associated with greater welfare inequality?
\end{itemize}
By reading Diamond (2016), you'll learn about a bunch of relevant concepts and tools:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Great Divergence (Moretti's \textit{New Geography of Jobs})
	\item Endogenous amenities
	\item Inferring welfare with multiple types
	\item ``Bartik (1991)'' shift-share instruments

BJH:
\begin{quote}
The claim for instrument validity in shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions must rely on some assumptions about the shocks, exposure shares, or both.\par
\end{quote}
GPSS say shares are exogenous.
\begin{quote}
Once we think about the shares as the instruments, the implied empirical strategy is an exposure research design, where the industry shares measure the differential exogenous exposure to the common shock
\end{quote}
AKM and BJH say shocks are exogenous.
BJH on ADH example:
\begin{quote}
exogeneity of industry employment shares is difficult to justify a priori since unobserved industry shocks (e.g., automation or innovation trends) are likely to affect regional outcomes through the same mixture of exposure shares. Our approach, in contrast, allows researchers to specify a set of shocks that are plausibly uncorrelated with such unobserved factors.\par

How do you build housing for poor people? You build housing for rich people in the past.
\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.2.687}{Rosenthal (\textit{AER} 2014)}:
\begin{quote}{\small
	While filtering has long been considered the primary mechanism by which markets supply low-income housing, direct estimates of that process have been absent.
	This has contributed to doubts about the viability of markets and to misplaced policy.
	I fill this gap by estimating a "repeat income" model using 1985-2011 panel data.
	Real annual filtering rates are faster for rental housing (2.5 percent) than owner-occupied (0.5 percent), vary inversely with the income elasticity of demand and house price inflation, and are sensitive to tenure transitions as homes age.
	For most locations, filtering is robust which lends support for housing voucher programs.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Write a spatial-equilibrium model with two skill types and elasticities to be estimated
	\item ``In the first step, a maximum likelihood estimator is used to identify how desirable each city is to each type of worker, on average, in each decade, controlling for workers' preferences to live close to their state of birth.''
	\item ``The second step of estimation uses a simultaneous equation nonlinear generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Moment restrictions on workers' preferences are combined with moments identifying cities' labor demand, housing supply, and amenity supply curves.''
	\item Housing supply elasticities are identified by the response of housing rents to the Bartik shocks across cities. 
	\item The interactions of the Bartik productivity shocks with cities' housing markets identify the labor demand elasticities.

	\item ``My results suggest that endogenous local amenity changes are an important mechanism driving workers' migration responses to local labor demand shocks.''
	\item ``the positive aggregate labor demand elasticities for college workers suggests that the endogenous productivity effects of college workers on college workers' productivity may be large and could overwhelm the standard forces leading to downward-sloping labor demand''
	\item ``an increase in well-being inequality between college and high school graduates which was significantly larger than would be suggested by the increase in the college wage gap alone''
	\item Immigrants more attracted to higher nominal wage and less deterred by higher nominal rents (c.f. \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20211241}{Albert and Monras 2022})

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Spatial distributions of skills and sectors are prominent in public discussion of cities, exploited for identification in empirical work, and potentially key to understanding agglomeration processes
	\item We need models with more than two skills groups and more than perfectly specialized/diversified cities
	\item Recent research exploits tools from assignment literature to characterize spatial sorting of skills and sectors
	\item Assignment mechanisms can be used in quantitative work via assumptions on components observed and unobserved by the econometrician -- Fr\'{e}chet distribution is most popular

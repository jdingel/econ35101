Solve the three following utility maximization problems.
For all three problems, 
the goods are indexed by *i=1,...,n*.
Let good *i* be available at price p<sub>i</sub>.
The individual has income *y* to spend on these goods.

### Discrete choice with Gumbel

Suppose that the consumer first chooses which good to buy and then the quantity of that good.

Let the utility associated with choosing good *i* be given by
*U<sub>i</sub>* = ln(*y*/*p<sub>i</sub>*) + &nu;<sub>i</sub>,
where &nu;<sub>i</sub> follows the Gumbel distribution given in equation (3.1) of [Train (2009)](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html).

Derive the probability that the consumer chooses good *i* and the expected demand of the consumer for good *i*.

### Discrete choice with Frechet

Again, suppose that the consumer first chooses which good to buy and then the quantity of that good.

Let the utility associated with choosing good *i* be given by
*U<sub>i</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>i</sub>y/p<sub>i</sub>*,
where &epsilon;<sub>i</sub> follows the Frechet distribution given by equation (4) of Eaton and Kortum (2002).

Derive the probability that the consumer chooses good *i* and the expected demand of the consumer for good *i*.

### Constant elasticity of substitution preferences

The consumer's utility function is 
*U =(&Sigma;<sub>i</sub> q<sub>i</sub><sup>&rho;</sup>)<sup>1/&rho;</sup>*
and
her budget constraint is 
*&Sigma;<sub>i</sub>q<sub>i</sub>p<sub>i</sub> &leq; y*.

Derive the consumer's demand for good *i*.

### Comparisons

Compare and contrast each of the demand system above to the two other demand systems.

### Urban theory

In Henderson (1974) there are a continuum of equilibria.
In Behrens, Duranton, Robert-Nicoud (2014), Proposition 4 says there is a unique talent-homogeneous equilibrium.
Is Proposition 4 correct? If it is correct, very clearly explain why talent heterogeneity makes the equilibrium unique when the homogeneous-worker case in Henderson (1974) yields multiple equilibria.
If it is incorrect, identify the error and state the correct claim.

### Trade and urban theory

Look at Behrens & Robert-Nicoud's "Agglomeration Theory with Heterogeneous Agents" chapter in the _Handbook of Urban and Regional Economics_.
On page 204, they propose a theory of metropolitan specialization in which different cities are home to different industries.
What is their prediction?
How can this be investigated empirically?
What is the role of comparative advantage?
Is comparative advantage sufficient for the existence of a specialized equilibrium?
